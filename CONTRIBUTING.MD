# GraphQL Standards Contribution Guide
This GraphQL Standards is an ever-evolving standard. This repository contains the rules 
for the GraphQL standard Worksome is following.

## When should an RFC be created?
An RFC should only be created when the contribution involves changing the definition of a rule
or adding a new rule.  
If the change is adding clarification or fixing grammar/styling errors, then a PR with the changes
should be created.  
An issue can also be added if for example the clarification might be specifying an edge-case which
was not considered in the RFC and the contributor is in doubt if the clarification might not be
following the original intent.

## How is an RFC created?
For creating an RFC a separate document is available under [`rfcs` folder](rfcs/README.md).

## Is grammar fixing PR's allowed?
Absolutely!  

Any PR which can improve the standard is highly encouraged, even a simple one character grammar fix
is appreciated.
