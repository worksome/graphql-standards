# GraphQL Standards
A repository to include our GraphQL API standards

## Conformance
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",  
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"  
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Licensing
The licensing purpose is to allow free usage and modifications without any needs for attribution, this has been enforced
via the [MIT license](https://github.com/worksome/graphql-standards/blob/main/LICENSE).


## Versioning
This standard is versioned through [Semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- `PATCH` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
